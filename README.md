# Humanities and Data Science

## Aims (Provisional)
The Humanities and Data Science group has been strengthening relationships and building collaborations at the intersection between data science and digital humanities since its creation in 2017. Raising the profile of data-driven humanities research at the national level and within the Turing, the group nourishes interdisciplinarity and promotes collaborations that not only seek research excellence but also strengthen links with national institutions and organisations, universities and The Alan Turing Institute. 


The synergy between humanities and data science becomes more important than ever before for tackling modern challenges brought by technological advances and AI and ensuring that such advancements are grounded in ethical and human-centred perspectives. By sustaining a constructive dialogue between the humanities and the sciences through the ongoing development of the group, we demonstrate how data science research can answer questions relevant to the humanities and vice versa, thus benefiting both fields. Stimulated by the prominence of the Alan Turing Institute, the group achieves its aims through a series of meetings, workshops, and joint research projects. 


Recognizing that translating fundamental data science research into lasting impact within the humanities requires interdisciplinary efforts, the interest group leverages the organisers' extensive experience in a wide range of disciplines. It fosters the sharing of diverse perspectives, methods, and knowledge by bringing together experts from digital humanities, historical data research, information, computer science, natural language processing, and other relevant disciplines.
